Hello, World! I'm Roland DUTAUZIET but you can call me Shawn.

Aspiring a Quantitative Analyst job, I'm currently learning Econometrics and Data-science at Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University.

I also enjoy playing adventure/RPG/Fight video games, watching anime, drawing  and I am learning piano and guitar 

In my toolkit, you'll find Data analysis and Econometrics skills . I'm  also proficient in Python/SAS/SQL and always eager to explore new challenges.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and if you have any questions or ideas, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Happy coding!
