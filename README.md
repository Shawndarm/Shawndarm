👋 Hello, World! I'm Roland DUTAUZIET but you can call me Shawn ❄️

🚀 Aspiring a Finance/Data scientist job, I'm currently learning Econometrics and Statistics at Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University.

👀 Indeed, I'm interested in advanced Econometrics and Machine learning, applied to the Finance/Insurance/Banking fields and the wonderful world of Data science in general.
    (I also enjoy playing adventure/RPG/Fight video games, and I can assure you that I'm not a noob 😎)

🛠️ In my toolkit, you'll find Data analysis and Econometrics skills . I'm  also proficient in Python/SAS/VBA and always eager to explore new challenges.

🌐 Let's connect and collaborate on projects that make a difference! Feel free to explore my repositories, and if you have any questions or ideas, don't hesitate to reach out. Together, let's create something amazing! 🤝

Happy coding! 🚀
